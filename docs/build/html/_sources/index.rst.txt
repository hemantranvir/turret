Welcome to Turret's documentation!
=====================================
Turret is a Pythonic wrapper for TensorRT.

Turret has been developed to solve the inconvenience of TensorRT's Python API and to
access functions which cannot be accessed by the Python API.
Turret provides high level API for accessing layers which is usually used for deep
learning and objects to create and use the inference engine.
